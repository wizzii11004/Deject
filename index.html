I've realized that losing you has been a huge loss in my life. It's been very hard for me.I don't know why I acted strangely during those days, but I'm sorry for that. We could have talked and sorted things out, but none of us took that step.At first, I thought our situation could be fixed and reversible, and you would be okay. But later (after May 9th), I realized it's irreversible. I've come to understand that I've lost you permanently, and things are not in my hands but in yours. I'am suffering the same pain that you hv suffered in those days...it's very difficult to describe:( I wish you all the best. Take care, Maanya.This is all I can say to you finally :( Happy birthday :)";
